# Fork of CakePHP 2 with support for PHP8

~~For original README content please check original repository: https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/tree/2.x~~

Unfortunately branch 2.x in original repository was taken down.

## Why I created this fork? 🤔 

CakePHP 2 stopped getting updates in the end of 2019 (AFAIR). Unfortunately in my case it's too expensive to migrate to newer versions of CakePHP. I started migrating to Symfony framework but I still use ORM from CakePHP (and actually I like it). So in order to keep up with newest PHP versions I decided to create fork of the framework.

## ⚠️ Before using this fork ⚠️

- Tests of CakePHP framework aren't refactored yet to support PHP 8. Main issue is old version of PHPUnit that is tightly coupled to framework's tests. Issue for fixing this situation is here: https://github.com/kamilwylegala/cakephp2-php8/issues/7
- Due to lack of tests ☝️ - **you need to rely** on tests in your application after integrating with this fork.
- If after integration you spot any issues related to framework please let me know by creating an issue or pull request with fix.

## Installation

This repository **is not** available in packagist, therefore your project's `composer.json` must be changed to point to custom repository.

Example configuration:
```
{
	"require": {
		"cakephp/cakephp": "dev-master as 2.10.24",
	},
	"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/kamilwylegala/cakephp2-php8"
        }
    ]
}
```

It means that composer will look at `master` branch of repository configured under `repositories` to resolve update of `cakephp/cakephp` package.

## Changelog

### 2021-12-20

    - `ArrayAccess`
    - `Countable`
    - `IteratorAggregate`
- PHP 8.0 requirement in composer.json
- **Warning:** Tests are not updated, Cake's tests rely on old version of PHPUnit so running them may show a lot of deprecations notices. Added issue to cover it: #7

### 2021-02-24

- Fixed ErrorHandler accordingly to PHP8 migration guide. Otherwise, error handler is logging too much and doesn't respect configured `error_reporting`.
